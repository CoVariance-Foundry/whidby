## Phases

### Phase A — Foundation integration (DONE)

Merges + baseline on `015-niche-finder-product-v1`:

- `f99029e` Merge 013-niche-operational-wiring (backend scoring, Supabase persistence, FastAPI `/api/niches/*`, `/api/metros/suggest`, admin wiring)
- `027b93c` Merge 014-consumer-niche-finder-wiring (consumer scaffolding — niche-finder page, reports SSR, proxies, RLS migration 005, CityAutocomplete)
- `3964526` fix(app): wire `@testing-library/jest-dom` types into tsconfig (baseline-green fix for apps/app tsc)
- `3331c8b` Landed design spec + design bundle

Baseline green:
- Python: 298 / 298 (ruff clean)
- apps/app vitest: 24 / 24 (tsc clean)
- apps/admin vitest: 35 / 35 (tsc clean)

## Known issues / lessons learned

**Plan defects found in execution:**
1. **B1 test duplicate-42 bug** — `getByText("42")` failed because two stat cards rendered `42`. Fix applied to both the plan and the test file: changed `Reports: "42"` → `Reports: "38"` so both values are unique and testable. Remaining plan tasks have been skimmed for similar issues; watch for them during each task's "verify test fails → implement → verify test passes" cycle.

**Subagent scope violations to guard against:**
1. First B1-B5 dispatch (replaced by a fresh one) modified `apps/app/src/app/api/agent/scoring/route.ts` and its test unprompted — a drive-by "improvement" to add `state` propagation. Reverted manually. Subsequent dispatches were given a stricter scope boundary clause: "You may create files ONLY inside `apps/app/src/components/home/`. You may NOT modify any other file under any circumstance." That language worked for B2-B5.

**Convention reminders for subagents:**
- Never use `[docs-sync-skip]` on this branch (the repo CLAUDE.md now forbids it outright).
- Use explicit `git add <path>` — never `git add -A`.
- Commit messages: exactly as the plan specifies for each task's Step 5.

## Final verification

```
apps/app: tsc ✅ | vitest 19 files, 56 tests ✅
apps/admin: tsc ✅ | vitest 9 files, 35 tests ✅
```
